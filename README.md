# Whisky-Tree

This is my take on the Apple Pie project, a word-guessing game.

Guess the word! Each time you guess correctly, letters fill in the blanks. Guess a letter wrong, though ... UH-OH! A whisky will fall off the Whisky Tree! Get the words right before all the whiskies dissappear. Try to score "Sips" while avoiding "Spills." Hint: all the words are Islay Scotch whisky distilleries!

A player wins by HAVING FUN.
